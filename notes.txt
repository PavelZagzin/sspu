Data issue:

Shareporint install base (SIB) file is missing response flags for some entries
 - as a solution we can try to generate support data out of other columns. Let's try to parse 'Package Product Description' column for the following keys:
   a)   NBD, Next - NBD
   b)   24x7  -  SD
   c)   CTR - CTR 


Too large report files:
+ Implement stream save - Fixed the error! 
- Check SIB file to filter out redundant entries


SIB file some entries missing serial numbers. 

Need a a way to find HW entry in SIB. Currently :
Mandatroty fields:
- SAID
- productNumber
- should have serial. if missing use #SAID#Product as dummy serial

How to add if entry is a valid HW entry? 

- should have valid response



Install base data report missing serial numbers. 

We need to generat merged contract/system data out of 2 reports
